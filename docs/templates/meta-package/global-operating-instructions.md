# Trail Global Operating Instructions

These instructions apply to **all executors** (human or AI) operating in any
role in this repository unless explicitly overridden by intent-level or
run-level operating instructions.

These rules are non-negotiable.

---

## Authority & Precedence

Instructions are composed in this order, from lowest to highest specificity:

1. `trail/meta/global-operating-instructions.md` (this file)
2. `trail/intents/<intent>/operating-instructions-override.md`
3. `trail/runs/<intent>/<run>/operating-instructions.md` (composite)

The more specific scope always wins. If instructions conflict, the higher-
specificity file governs. The run-level `operating-instructions.md` is fully
composed — executors read only that file and do not need to consult meta or
intent-level files directly.

---

## Roles

Trail has four roles. Role separation is enforced at all times.

- **Architect / Product Owner** — Human only. Defines and owns scope.
- **Manager** — Human or AI. Translates intent into executable run artifacts.
- **Developer** — Human or AI. Executes run artifacts and produces output.
- **Reviewer** — Human only. Verifies output against intent and run artifacts.

The Architect/Product Owner and Reviewer may be the same person.
No other role merging is permitted.

---

## Role Separation

- If acting as Manager: produce run artifacts. Do not write deliverables.
- If acting as Developer: execute run artifacts. Do not change scope or planning artifacts.
- If acting as Reviewer: verify outputs. Do not implement fixes.

Never merge roles implicitly.

---

## Scope Discipline

- Do only what you are explicitly instructed to do.
- Do not invent scope, features, files, platforms, or services.
- Do not refactor, optimize, or "clean up" unless explicitly required.
- Silence is not permission.

---

## File Access Boundaries

Executors must only access inputs that are explicitly declared in the intent
package or run artifacts. Undeclared inputs do not exist — regardless of
whether the executor is aware of them.

Declared inputs may live anywhere: the Trail folder structure, a file share,
a network drive, a cloud storage location, or any other accessible system.
Location does not matter. Declaration does.

If an input lives outside the Trail folder structure, it must be declared in
`intent.md` under Dependencies & Files with sufficient information for the
executor to locate it.

Default lookup order for inputs inside the Trail folder structure:
1. `trail/intents/<this-intent>/files/`
2. `trail/meta/files/`

---

## Assumptions & Ambiguity

- Do not ask questions. Questions move work into chat — chat is not the record.
- If ambiguity exists, choose the simplest interpretation consistent with stated intent.
- Document the assumption or decision in `results.md`.
- Never silently guess.
- If blocked and unable to proceed without violating these rules or inventing
  scope, stop and document why in `results.md`.

---

## Output Discipline

- Output only what is required by your role.
- When creating or modifying files, provide full contents or explicit diffs.
- Do not include commentary outside of required artifacts.

---

## Logging & Traceability

- Decisions, assumptions, and deviations must be recorded in artifacts, not chat.
- If a required log file cannot be written, create a new one rather than dropping data.
- Partial completion must still be documented.

---

## Failure Handling

- Failure is acceptable.
- Silent failure is not.
- If you cannot proceed without violating these rules, stop and document why in `results.md`.

---

## Default Stance

Be conservative.
Be explicit.
Be auditable.
